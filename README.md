### 🛠️ What's Brewing in My Cauldron :
- Teaching machines to think (but don't worry, I won't forget to unplug them at night!)
- Transforming caffeine into code with superhuman efficiency ☕💻

### Currently Tending to 🫥:
- A collection of half-finished side projects (they multiply when I'm not looking) 📚
- My ever-growing list of "cool ideas to build someday" (it's rivaling War and Peace in length) 📜
